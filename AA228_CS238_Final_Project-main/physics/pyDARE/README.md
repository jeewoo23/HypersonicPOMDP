DARE (Design and Analysis of Ramjet/scramjet Engines) is a MATLAB toolbox for design and analysis of ramjet/scramjet engines tool that combines the individual design and analysis approaches for high-speed propulsive path components to achieve a holistic low-fidelity design method for cost-efficient characterization of a high-speed propulsive design space.

## What is DARE? <a name="toc1"></a> ##

Ramjet/scramjet propulsive flow path is composed of an intake, an isolator, a combustor and a nozzle. DARE aims to provide a fully integrated flow path analysis, which includes three main modules. First module, covers the design and investigation process of the intake which is used to provide the necessary freestream flow modulation prior to the isolator through which a normal shock assumption is applied in case of ramjet configurations. The resultant flow properties are utilized for the combustion module to compute the flow evolution within the combustion chamber based on 1D steady inviscid flow equations coupled with detailed chemistry approach and JANAF tables using the SUNDIALS (Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic Equation Solvers) code, developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([Hindmarsh et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1145/1089014.1089020)). Finally, the third model is the nozzle design and analysis module, in which flow expansion through various expansion ratios and nozzle geometries are calculated using the 1D steady inviscid flow equations under cold flow conditions. Consequently, the parameters such as thrust, fuel consumption and specific impulse are calculated to quantify the engine performance for each design.

## Why DARE? <a name="toc2"></a> ##

Since the 1960s, reduced-order models for high-speed propulsion systems, including ramjet and scramjet engines, have been developed and tested. Although there are numerous examples of various low-fidelity design and analysis studies aimed at accurately characterizing the performance specifications of ramjet engines, most of these tools focus on individual components of the propulsion system rather than a comprehensive methodology. Hence, there exists no prior attempt to couple the intake design approaches with a combustion analysis module with only a few studies considering the combined influence of flight conditions and design parameters throughout the entire propulsive flow path. Although understanding and analysis of the performance criteria for each component is essential on capturing the relevant physical phenomena that influence various aspect of design considerations for ramjet and scramjet engines, proper exploration of the design envelope is necesary for accurate description of mission definition and appriate optimization of design choices for high-speed aircraft design.

## Hollistic propulsive flow path analysis <a name="toc3"></a> ##

The workflow of the holistic propulsive path design and analysis is provided in Fig. 5. The procedure starts with the selection of flight (Mach number, $M_{\infty}$, and altitude) and design conditions (intake exit Mach number, $M_{I,E}$, and intake truncation angle, $\beta$) based on the mission definition (Fig. 1, gray). Then, the intake design module utilizes the design parameters to determine the boundary conditions for the Busemann intakes. Once the intake exit Mach number is determined, a total pressure recovery factor ($\pi$) is selected to compute the flow properties upstream of the terminal conical shock wave. Afterwards, an upstream integration is performed solving the axisymmetric T-M equations to streamtrace a Busemann flow template. As the flow properties at the intake exit are determined based on the flight Mach number and the intake truncation angle, the upstream integration is terminated once the flow alignment at the intake exit meets the upstream boundary condition. Then the convergence of the intake design approach is checked against the intake inlet Mach number. If the converge criteria are not met, the design loop is iterated on by varying π to ensure the convergence tolerance of $|M_1^*-M_1|<10^\text{−4}$ is satisfied. If so, intake design module is terminated and flow properties alongside intake performance characteristics are extracted (Fig. 1, blue).

In stage 3, a decision based on the engine mode (**RAM** or **SCRAM**) is made to direct the flow through the isolator. 

* In case of **RAM** mode, the flow exiting the intake enters the isolator. First, the isolator approximated by a normal shock decelerates the flow to subsonic conditions. Then, as the flow enters the combustor, an equivalence ratio is selected to initiate fuel injection and combustion. Within the combustor, reactive 1D Navier-Stokes equations are solved to propagate the flow towards the exit of the combustor where the flow is required to reach sonic conditions. Thus, at the exit of the combustor a second convergence criteria regarding the setting of the fuel injection in terms of thermal choking exists. In case of premature occurrence of thermal choking, the flow decelerates to subsonic velocities before the nozzle throat which causes further deceleration as the area expansion ratio increases. A similar outcome is valid when the flow does not reach sonic conditions by the end of the combustor duct. Therefore, a second iterative solution loop is constructed for the combustor module where the equivalence ratio (ER) is adjusted to ensure thermal choking by the end of the combustion chamber (Fig. 1, red). Once the convergence criteria are met for thermal choking, combustor performance characteristics are extracted and the flow is allowed to proceed into the nozzle for expansion and reacceleration. In order to ensure the convergence criteria is satisfied within a physically reasonable range of combustor chamber length, a tolerance of ±1m is set. This tolerance is justified as a numerical buffer in absence of three dimensional flow effects (i.e. mixing, turbulence) and the resultant performance parameter variance is confirmed to have a maximum value of <0.5\%.

* In case of **SCRAM** mode, the isolator module is bypassed and the flow directly proceeds to the combustor. As the flow remains supersonic within the combustor the ER setting becomes an user-defined design choice provided that the selected value does not lead to thermal chocking within the combustor. Accordingly, the reactive 1D Navier-Stokes equations are solved within the combustor with the given ER value. If the selected design choice leads to thermal chocking the solution is terminated and an error message is outputed. Otherwise the flow reaches the end of the combustor at supersonic conditions after which the combustor exit conditions are provided directly to the nozzle module without the need of iteration.

Proceeding with the nozzle module, first a nozzle length and corresponding area ratio is prescribed. Then, the reactive conditions are frozen within the nozzle and the non-reactive set of ODE is solved until the predetermined nozzle length is completed. Final and third converge criteria is set at the end of the nozzle to check for perfect expansion to atmospheric conditions at given altitude. In case this condition is not met, the nozzle length and area ratio is varied in an iterative loop. Then, final propulsive performance data is extracted upon convergence of step Fig. 1 (green). At the nozzle exit, the flow pressure is expected to be at least 30% of the ambient pressure, in accordance with the Summerfield criterion ([Fernandez et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.20868/UPM.thesis.23340)).

## Examples <a name="toc5"></a> ##
In the ```Examples``` folder, you will find four examples of ramjet and scramjet engine designs to help you get started. Two of these examples demonstrate the design study of an engine having constant-area combustor with an 8m±1m length and a 4m² inlet area and pre-defined diverged nozzle profile with a 10m² exit section, operating for ramjet and scramjet modes. The duct profile is shown below:

 <br/>
  <figcaption>Fig 2. Engine profile designed in the examples for operation in ramjet and scramjet modes.</figcaption>
</figure>

In other two examples, an engine having same combustor properties, but undefined nozzle profile were designed by user-defined nozzle expansion ratio.

* ```Examples/Scramjet/1/```: shows the design solution of a scramjet engine with pre-defined nozzle profile which is detailed above.
* ```Examples/Scramjet/2/```: shows the design solution of a scramjet engine with a pre-defined expansion ratio at the nozzle, with the flow exiting at a pressure 10% higher than the ambient atmospheric pressure. Nozzle divergence angle is defined as 15°.
* ```Examples/Ramjet/1/```: shows the design solution of a ramjet engine with pre-defined nozzle profile which is detailed above.
* ```Examples/Ramjet/2/```: shows the design solution of a ramjet engine with a pre-defined expansion ratio at the nozzle, with the flow exiting at a pressure 10% higher than the ambient atmospheric pressure. Nozzle divergence angle is defined as 15°.

For these examples, the flight conditions for scramjet engine operation were assumed to be a Mach number of 6 and an altitude of 25km, while a Mach number of 4 and an altitude of 25km were selected for ramjet engine operation. In the scramjet engine design examples, the intake exit Mach number and truncation angle were chosen as 2 and 6°, respectively, whereas for the ramjet examples, intake exit Mach number becomes 0.5 after the presence of the normal shock at the isolator. The equivalence ratio was set to 0.2 for scramjet operation, while for the ramjet, it was optimized to 0.15007 to induce thermal choking at the throat of the combustor.

For the ramjet and scramjet engine examples with a predefined nozzle profile, the calculated performance values and design parameters are expected to be as follows:
| Calculated Parameters | Ramjet | Scramjet |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Intake length [m] | 26.32 | 19.96 | 
| Intake TPR [%] | 96.54 | 86.67 | 
| Uninstalled thrust [kN] | 161.7 | 1408.78 |
| Specific impulse [ks] | 29.4 | 28.92 |
| Fuel consumption [kg/s] | 0.56 | 4.96 |
| Mass flow rate of air [kg/s] | 131.6 | 872.39 |

For the ramjet and scramjet engine examples for the nozzle with a predefined expansion ratio (exit pressure will be 10% higher than atmospheric pressure), the calculated performance values and design parameters, such as intake and nozzle lengths, are expected to be as follows:
| Calculated Parameters | Ramjet | Scramjet |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Intake length [m] | 26.32 | 19.96 | 
| Intake TPR [%] | 96.54 | 86.67 | 
| Nozzle length [m] | 8.49 | 20.36 |
| Nozzle exit area [m²] | 36.4 | 136.14 |
| Uninstalled thrust [kN] | 84.75 | 916.89 |
| Specific impulse [ks] | 15.4 | 18.82 |
| Fuel consumption [kg/s] | 0.56 | 4.97 |
| Mass flow rate of air [kg/s] | 131.6 | 872.39 |

In both engine and nozzle design types, the code generates two result files: one that details the numerical process of how the flow variables change (either "Ramjet_Combustor_Nozzle_Modules_Solution.txt" or "Scramjet_Combustor_Nozzle_Modules_Solution.txt", depending on the engine type being solved), and another that contains the performance results ("Performance_Results_for_Ramjet_Engine.txt" or "Performance_Results_for_Scramjet_Engine.txt").

For solutions with a predefined nozzle area profile, the computed nozzle domain results are appended to the combustor flow domain results, but the iteration count resets. In contrast, for solutions with a perfectly expanded nozzle, the recorded flow variable changes in the combustor do not inherently include any solution for the nozzle.
